FancyTest
=============

don't use it, you will hit twitter api limitation ....

This project was an attempt to make a twitter like feed, from public tweeter timelines, with a masonry plugin on right displaying media. Then I wanted to change the css framework from bootstrap to spectre and lost the masonry. I discontinued the project due to api limitation and the last regression, i keep the code here because of some usefull harvestable part.
